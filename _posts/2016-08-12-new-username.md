Hello again! I've recently undergone an online handler name change, transitioning from 'Legacy47' to 'FiLeZekk'. I believe this new username is much more unique and I had been planning on changing my name for a while now. While 'Legacy47' is still quite unique the only downfall I find is that it contains numbers and is still used on various websites before me. Thus I have finally made the big transition and am now referred to as 'FiLeZekk' from now on. That being said I have already changed my username on the various websites that I have an account for. Such as my youtube channel is now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5bLF49VJd6_9hbJhZ0dgAw">FiLeZekk</a>, following this my website has also migrated to <a href="http://filezekk.tk">http://FiLeZekk.tk</a>. Another thing to take note of is that my osu! username still remains as 'Legacy47', this will be changed in due time.

On another topic, I have discontinued legacytech.tk as mentioned <a href="2016-07-18-quick-update.md">previously</a>, but <a href="http://legacy47.tk">http://legacy47.tk</a> still remains active. I have made plans to re-direct this to <a href="http://filezekk.tk">http://FiLeZekk.tk</a> one day. Also both legacy47 and filezekk sites have been updated to the newer layout as promised previously and I believe that the revamp of the website has a much more prominent style and gives a much more professional look. The subdomains on legacy47 have been closed and have been migrated to filezekk.tk.

Below you will find the changes in the websites links.

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://legacy47.tk">http://legacy47.tk</a></li>
