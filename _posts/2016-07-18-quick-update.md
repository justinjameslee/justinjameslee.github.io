Hello! I haven't been doing much programming and coding recently. As such I haven't had much to post here, however recently due to my lack of activity my website <a href="http://legacy47.tk">http://legacy47.tk</a> Is currently down and is undergoing a new website revamp. However another website that I used to own <a href="http://legacytech.tk">http://legacytech.tk</a> is no longer under my ownership this is mainly a quick update on what is going on. 

Therefore <a href="http://legacy47.tk">http://legacy47.tk</a> may be up and running in a few days time however will still have the old layout as it did before. The links on the site leading to <a href="http://legacytech.tk">http://legacytech.tk</a> will definately not work and some other broken links I would assume. However once it is up and running I will start revamping the website to a possibly new style not decided yet at the moment. Though I will update the site once it has undergone the change

Below you will find what websites I have left.

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://legacy47.tk">http://legacy47.tk</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://onefud.legacy47.tk">http://onefud.legacy47.tk</a></li>
