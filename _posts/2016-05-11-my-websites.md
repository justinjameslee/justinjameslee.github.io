Hello! I'm now writing another blog post since I don't have much to do today. Today i'll be talking about some other websites that I own. 

My Websites:
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://legacy47.tk">http://legacy47.tk</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://onefud.legacy47.tk">http://onefud.legacy47.tk</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://cgstournament.legacy47.tk">http://cgstournament.legacy47.tk</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.goldlineit.com.au">http://www.goldlineit.com.au</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://justinjameslee.github.io">http://justinjameslee.github.io</a></li>
</ul>

So, firstly why did I make these..

Well to begin with these were mainly small projects that I had started doing alone, some of them turned out to be successful while others are still undeveloped.

And what they do..

<ul>
    <li>http://legacy47.tk | 'Repository' or my public projects.
    <li>http://onefud.legacy47.tk | Collaboration project made with complete custom css
    <li>http://cgstournament.legacy47.tk | Late tournament details and past event.
    <li>http://legacytech.tk | More formal version of legacy47.tk
    <li>http://www.goldlineit.com.au | Finished product with first client
    <li>http://justinjameslee.github.io | This website :^)
</ul>

Be sure to check them if you have time!
