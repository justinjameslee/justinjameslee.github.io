They have many tutorials and documentations if you every have any inquires just head on over there. I felt that going down the Jekyll route for a new webpage was a bit mainstream so I decided to use Hugo. \r\n\r\nHere you will find posts ranging from random posts to interesting images and the occasional programming fix. I am Justin Lee, online I'm referd to as Legacy47 or FiLeZekk which is my Steam username. If your interested you can add me anytime, just leave me a comment on my profile page. Well this is the end of my first post, I hope you enjoy your stay here!\r\n",
