Hello and Welcome! I have just installed <a target="_blank" href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> onto my github pages, it has a simple and easy to use structure which is really neat. If you are planning on making a similar page like this one, I suggest you head on over there as they include detailed documentations on how Jekyll actually works. Originally I had planned on using a different site generator by the name of 'Hugo', unfortunately it was not compatible with github hosting as such I have resorted to the 'mainstream' method of blogging.

Anyway, when you have time I would suggest you heading to my <a href="http://justinjameslee.github.io/about">about page</a>, it includes information about the sort of posts you will find here. Well this will be the end of my first post, I hope you enjoy your stay here!
